1.  LICENSE GRANT.  Subject to the terms of this Agreement,
Service Stack grants to Customer, during the Term, a limited, revocable,
non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable license to install
and use the Software on a single computer for a period until 31st December 2013 after

evaluating the Software solely for Customer's own internal business
purpose in accordance with the Software documentation and other terms
and conditions of this Agreement.  Customer's right to use the Software
shall lapse at the end of the Evaluation Period and, at that time, the
Software will then become inoperable.  If Customer desires to continue
using the Software, Customer must pay the applicable fees and must enter
into another licensing agreement with Service Stack unless Service Stack agrees to
extend this Agreement upon request of Customer.  If Customer is interested
in a full commercial license, please contact:  team@servicestack.net.

2.  RESTRICTIONS ON USE.  Customer acknowledges that the Software
and the structure, organization, and source code thereof constitute
valuable trade secrets of Service Stack.  Accordingly, except as expressly

Customer will not, and will not permit any third party to (a) modify,
adapt, alter, translate, or create derivative works from the Software;

Agreement to provide any support or consultation concerning the Software;
provided, however, Service Stack may, in its sole discretion, provide Customer

evaluation activities of Customer under this Agreement. The furnishing of
such support or consultation will not subject Service Stack to any liability,
whether in contract, tort or otherwise.  Customer is responsible for
providing all applicable hardware and any third party software or required
installation and configuration services required for the operation of
the Software.  Any third party software license agreements will be agreed
to by Customer and the applicable third party software vendor.

notifying Service Stack at:  team@servicestack.net.  If Customer breaches any
provision of this Agreement, this Agreement will automatically terminate.
Upon the expiration of the Evaluation Period or any termination of this
Agreement, the license granted to Customer will terminate.  The provisions
of Sections 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 and 12 shall survive termination
or expiration of this Agreement for any reason.

7.  CONFIDENTIALITY.  Service Stack may disclose certain information
regarding the business of Service Stack and its suppliers, Including the
Software and technical, marketing, financial, employee, planning,
and other confidential or proprietary information of Service Stack or its

knew or should have known, under the circumstances, was considered
confidential or proprietary by Service Stack will be considered Confidential
Information. Customer agrees (a) not to disclose Confidential information
to any persons outside its organization, except to its consultants or
agents who agree in writing to protect such Confidential information as
required herein; and (b) to use the Confidential information only for
the purpose of evaluating the Software.

8.  DISCLAIMER.  CUSTOMER ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT CUSTOMER'S USE

EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES WITH REGARD TO THE SOFTWARE, WHETHER
EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, Including, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR

10. COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS.  Customer shall comply with all laws,
regulations, rules, ordinances and orders applicable to its use of the
Software. Without limiting the foregoing, Customer shall comply with
the relevant export administration and control laws and regulations,
as may be amended from time to time, Including, without limitation, the
United States Export Administration Act, to ensure that the Software
is not shipped, transferred or exported (directly or indirectly) in
violation of U.S. law.

11. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.  The Software is a "commercial item"
as that term is defined at 48 C.F.R. 2.101, consisting of "commercial
computer software" and "commercial computer software documentation" as
such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212.  Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212
and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4, all U.S. Government end
users acquire the Software with only those rights set forth therein.

12. MISCELLANEOUS.  Customer may not assign or delegate, directly or
indirectly, by operation of law or otherwise, this Agreement or any of its
rights or obligations under this Agreement (including the license rights
granted to Customer to the Software) to any third party.  Any attempted
assignment or transfer in violation of the foregoing will be null and
void and of no effect.  This Agreement will be subject to and governed
by the laws of the State of Nevada and the United States of America
without regard for its conflicts of law principles that would require
application of the laws of a different state or country. The federal
and state courts for Clark County Nevada shall have jurisdiction over
any disputes, claims or controversies arising out of or relating to this
Agreement, and Customer hereby irrevocably waives any objection to the
jurisdiction of such courts over any such dispute, claim or controversy.
All modifications, waivers and amendments must be in writing and signed
by both parties. Any waiver or failure to enforce any provision of
this Agreement on one occasion will not be deemed a waiver of any other
provision or of such provision on any other occasion. If any provision
of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be
unenforceable for any reason, the remaining provisions hereof shall
be unaffected and continue in full force and effect.  This Agreement
constitutes the entire agreement between the parties regarding the
subject hereof and supersedes all prior or contemporaneous agreements,
understandings and communications, whether written or oral.
