## Early life

As a child, Grohl's family relocated from Warren, Ohio, to Springfield, Virginia, a suburb of 
Washington, D.C. Three years later, when Grohl was six, his parents divorced, and Grohl grew up 
living with his mother.

At the age of twelve, Grohl began learning to play guitar. He quickly grew tired of lessons and 
instead taught himself, and began playing in bands with friends. A year later, Grohl and his 
sister spent the summer in Evanston, Illinois, at their cousin Tracy's house. Tracy introduced them 
to punk rock by taking the pair to shows by a variety of punk bands. His first concert was in 1982 to 
see Naked Raygun at The Cubby Bear in Chicago when he was 13 years old. "From then on we were totally 
punk," Grohl explained. "We went home and bought Maximumrocknroll and tried to figure it all out."
In Virginia, Grohl attended Thomas Jefferson High School as a freshman and sophomore. He was elected 
vice president of his freshman class and played bits of songs by bands like the Circle Jerks and Bad 
Brains over the school intercom before his morning announcements. During his junior year, Grohl and his 
mother decided that he should transfer to Bishop Ireton High School in Alexandria because his marijuana 
usage was affecting his grades.

While in high school, Grohl played in several local bands, including a stint on guitar in a band called 
Freak Baby. While playing in Freak Baby, he taught himself to play drums. When Freak Baby kicked out 
its bass player, Grohl decided to switch to drums, and the new band called themselves Mission Impossible.
During his developing years as a drummer, Grohl cited John Bonham as his greatest influence, and 
eventually had Bonham's three-circle logo tattooed on his wrist. Mission Impossible later rebranded 
themselves Fast before breaking up, after which Grohl joined the post-punk-influenced hardcore punk band 
Dain Bramage.
Many of Grohl's early influences were gained at the 9:30 club, a live music venue in Washington D.C.: 

> "I went to the 9:30 club hundreds of times. I was always so excited to get there, and I was always 
> bummed when it closed. I spent my teenage years at the club and saw some shows that changed my life."
