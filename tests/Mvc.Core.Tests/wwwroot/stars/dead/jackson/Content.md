Michael Joseph Jackson (August 29, 1958 - June 25, 2009) was an American recording artist, entertainer, 
and businessman. Often referred to as the King of Pop, or by his initials MJ, Jackson is recognized 
as the most successful entertainer of all time by Guinness World Records. His contributions to music, 
dance, and fashion, along with a much-publicized personal life, made him a global figure in popular 
culture for over four decades. The seventh child of the Jackson family, he debuted on the professional 
music scene along with his brothers as a member of The Jackson 5 in 1964, and began his solo career in 
1971.

In the early 1980s, Jackson became a dominant figure in popular music. The music videos for his songs, 
including those of "Beat It", "Billie Jean", and "Thriller", were credited with breaking down racial 
barriers and transforming the medium into an art form and promotional tool. The popularity of these 
videos helped to bring the then relatively new television channel MTV to fame. With videos such as 
"Black or White" and "Scream" he continued to be highly visible on MTV in the 1990s, and also began 
to forge a reputation as a touring artist. Through stage and video performances, Jackson popularized 
a number of complicated dance techniques, such as the robot and the moonwalk, to which he gave the 
name. His distinctive sound and style has influenced numerous hip hop, post-disco, contemporary R&B, 
pop and rock artists.

## Early life

### Early life and The Jackson 5 (1958-1975)

Michael Jackson was born on August 29, 1958, the eighth of ten children in an African American 
working-class family who lived in a small 3-room house in Gary, Indiana, an industrial city near 
Chicago. His mother, Katherine Esther Scruse, was a devout Jehovah's Witness, and his father, 
Joseph Walter "Joe" Jackson, was a steel mill worker who performed with an R&B band called The Falcons. 
Jackson had three sisters: Rebbie, La Toya, and Janet, and five brothers: Jackie, Tito, Jermaine, 
Marlon, and Randy. A sixth brother, Brandon, died shortly after birth. 

Jackson had a troubled relationship with his father, Joe. Joseph acknowledged in 2003 that he regularly 
whipped Jackson as a boy. Jackson stated that he was physically and emotionally abused during 
incessant rehearsals, though he also credited his father's strict discipline with playing a large 
role in his success. Jackson first spoke openly about his childhood abuse in an interview with 
Oprah Winfrey, broadcast in February 1993. He admitted that he had often cried from loneliness and 
he would vomit on the sight of his father. Jackson's father was also said to have verbally abused 
Jackson, saying that he had a fat nose on numerous occasions. In fact, Michael Jackson's deep 
dissatisfaction with his appearance, his nightmares and chronic sleep problems, his tendency to remain 
hyper-compliant especially with his father, and to remain childlike throughout his adult life are in 
many ways consistent with the effects of this chronic maltreatment he endured as a young child.
