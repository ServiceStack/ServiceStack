Born in Tupelo, Mississippi, Presley moved to Memphis, Tennessee, with his family at the age of 13. 
He began his career there in 1954, working with Sun Records owner Sam Phillips, who wanted to bring 
the sound of African American music to a wider audience. Accompanied by guitarist Scotty Moore and 
bassist Bill Black, Presley was the most important popularizer of rockabilly, an uptempo, 
backbeat-driven fusion of country and rhythm and blues. RCA Victor acquired his contract in a deal 
arranged by Colonel Tom Parker, who went on to manage the singer for over two decades. Presley's first 
RCA single, "Heartbreak Hotel", released in January 1956, was a number-one hit. He became the leading 
figure of the newly popular sound of rock and roll with a series of network television appearances and 
chart-topping records. His energized interpretations of songs, many from African American sources, and 
his uninhibited performance style made him enormously popular-and controversial. In November 1956, he 
made his film debut in Love Me Tender.

Drafted into military service in 1958, Presley relaunched his recording career two years later with 
some of his most commercially successful work. He staged few concerts however, and guided by Parker,
proceeded to devote much of the 1960s to making Hollywood movies and soundtrack albums, most of them 
critically derided. In 1968, after seven years away from the stage, he returned to live performance in 
a celebrated comeback television special that led to an extended Las Vegas concert residency and a 
string of profitable tours. In 1973 Presley staged the first concert broadcast globally via satellite, 
Aloha from Hawaii. Prescription drug abuse severely compromised his health, and he died suddenly in 
1977 at the age of 42.

## Early life

### Childhood in Tupelo

Elvis Presley was born on January 8, 1935, in Tupelo, Mississippi, to 18-year-old Vernon Elvis and 
22-year-old Gladys Love Presley. In the two-room shotgun house built by his father in readiness for 
the birth. Jesse Garon Presley, his identical twin brother, was delivered 35 minutes before him, 
stillborn. As an only child, Presley became close to both parents and formed an unusually tight bond 
with his mother. The family attended an Assembly of God church where he found his initial musical 
inspiration. 

Presley's ancestry was primarily a Western European mix: On his mother's side, he was Scots-Irish, 
with some French Norman; one of Gladys's great-great-grandmothers was Cherokee. His father's forebears
were of Scottish or German origin. Gladys was regarded by relatives and friends as the dominant 
member of the small family. Vernon moved from one odd job to the next, evidencing little ambition.
The family often relied on help from neighbors and government food assistance. In 1938, they lost 
their home after Vernon was found guilty of altering a check written by the landowner. He was jailed 
for eight months, and Gladys and Elvis moved in with relatives. 

### Teenage life in Memphis

In November 1948, the family moved to Memphis, Tennessee. After residing for nearly a year in rooming 
houses, they were granted a two-bedroom apartment in the public housing complex known as the Courts.
Enrolled at Humes High School, Presley received only a C in music in eighth grade. When his music 
teacher told him he had no aptitude for singing, he brought in his guitar the next day and sang a 
recent hit, "Keep Them Cold Icy Fingers Off Me", in an effort to prove otherwise. A classmate later 
recalled that the teacher "agreed that Elvis was right when he said that she didn't appreciate his 
kind of singing." He was generally too shy to perform openly, and was occasionally bullied by 
classmates who viewed him as a "mama's boy". In 1950, he began practicing guitar regularly under 
the tutelage of Jesse Lee Denson, a neighbor two-and-a-half years his senior. They and three other 
boys-including two future rockabilly pioneers, brothers Dorsey and Johnny Burnette-formed a loose 
musical collective that played frequently around the Courts. That September, he began ushering 
at Loew's State Theater. Other jobs followed during his school years: Precision Tool, Loew's again, 
and MARL Metal Products.
