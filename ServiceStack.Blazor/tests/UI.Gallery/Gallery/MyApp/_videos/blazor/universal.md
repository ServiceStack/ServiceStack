We walk through the process of creating universal Blazor API components for Blazor Server 
and Blazor WASM using the ServiceStack.Blazor library. 

We'll show how Developers can create UI components that can be shared between their Blazor 
applications without worrying about the hosting model used. This allows developers to streamline 
their development process and reduce the amount of code they need to write, making it easier to build 
and maintain complex Apps.
