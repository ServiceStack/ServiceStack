# v4.0.60 Release Notes

> Quick fix release build that resolves issues reported with Add ServiceStack Reference in v4.0.58.
The v4.0.58 Release Notes below contains new features added in this release:

We've got another jam-packed release with improvements and polish across the board, starting with exciting 
new API Key and JWT Auth Providers enabling fast, stateless and centralized Auth Services, a modernized API 
surface for OrmLite, new GEO capabilities in Redis, Logging for Slack, performance and memory improvements 
across all ServiceStack and libraries including useful utilities you can reuse to improve performance in 
your own Apps. 

## Authentication

ServiceStack's Authentication is built around the simple 
[HTTP Session](https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack/wiki/Sessions) 
model where after successful authentication a 
[Typed Users Session](https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack/wiki/Sessions#using-typed-sessions-in-servicestack)
is persisted in the registered `ICacheClient`. A Cookie is then set on the HTTP Response in order to 
establish an **Authenticated Session** for subsequent requests. Prior to this release the Users Session was 
always persisted, including for `IAuthWithRequest` Auth Providers which would send Authentication Info with 
each Request, these include:

 - `BasicAuthProvider` - Allow users to authenticate with [HTTP Basic Auth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication)
 - `DigestAuthProvider` - Allow users to authenticate with [HTTP Digest Authentication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digest_access_authentication)
 - `AspNetWindowsAuthProvider` - Allow users to authenticate with integrated Windows Auth

### Sessionless "Auth With Request" Providers

By default all `IAuthWithRequest` Auth Providers no longer persist the Users Session in the Cache, the result
of which requires each of the above Auth Providers to resend their Credentials / Auth Info on every request, 
as was already the current and expected behavior in all Service Clients which supported these Authentication 
options.

Previously only the **First** Request required sending Auth Info, as any subsequent requests could access the 
previously established **Authenticated Session**. Whilst it shouldn't be required, should you need to restore 
the previous behavior, you can persist Sessions with:

```csharp
Plugins.Add(new AuthFeature(..., new IAuthProvider[] {
    new BasicAuthProvider { PersistSession = true },
});
```

No longer persisting User Sessions doesn't impact the existing Auth functionality as the Authenticated Users 
Session is simply attached to the current Request inside the `IRequest.Items` dictionary, 
conceptually similar to:

```csharp
req.Items[Keywords.Session] = new AuthUserSession { IsAuthenticated = true, ... };
```

Which is what gets returned whenever the Session is accessed from inside your Services:

```csharp
var session = base.GetSession(); 
var session = base.SessionAs<AuthUserSession>();
```

Or outside the Service, anywhere you have access to the current `IRequest`:

```csharp
var session = req.GetSession(); 
var session = req.SessionAs<AuthUserSession>();
```

All above APIs return the Typed User Session attached to the request. 

This refresher on ServiceStack Sessions which now sees `IAuthWithRequest` sessions only lasting within 
the scope of the request will serve useful in understanding the new Auth Providers as they also both 
implement `IAuthWithRequest` and authenticate with every request.

## API Key Auth Provider

The new API Key Auth Provider provides an alternative method for allowing external 3rd Parties access to 
your protected Services without needing to specify a password. API Keys is the preferred approach for 
many well-known public API providers used in system-to-system scenarios for several reasons:

 - **Simple** - It integrates easily with existing HTTP Auth functionality
 - **Independent from Password** - Limits exposure to the much more sensitive master user passwords that 
 should ideally never be stored in plain-text. Resetting User's Password or password reset strategies 
 wont invalidate existing systems configured to use API Keys
 - **Entropy** - API Keys are typically much more secure than most normal User Passwords. The configurable 
default has **24 bytes** of entropy (Guids have 16 bytes) generated from a secure random number generator 
that encodes to **32 chars** using URL-safe Base64 (Same as Stripe)
 - **Performance** - Thanks to their much greater entropy and independence from user-chosen passwords,
 API Keys are validated as fast as possible using a datastore Index. This is contrast to validating hashed 
 user passwords which as a goal require usage of slower and more computationally expensive algorithms to 
 try make brute force attacks infeasible

Like most ServiceStack providers the new API Key Auth Provider is simple to use, integrates seamlessly with
ServiceStack existing Auth model and includes Typed end-to-end client/server support. 

For familiarity and utility we've modelled our implementation around Stripe's API Key functionality whilst
sharing many of the benefits of ServiceStack's Auth Providers:

#### Simple and Integrated

Like all of [ServiceStack's Auth Providers](https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack/wiki/Authentication-and-authorization)
registration is as easy as adding `ApiKeyAuthProvider` to the `AuthFeature` list of Auth Providers:

```csharp
Plugins.Add(new AuthFeature(...,
    new IAuthProvider[] {
        new ApiKeyAuthProvider(AppSettings),
        new CredentialsAuthProvider(AppSettings),
        //...
    }));
```

The `ApiKeyAuthProvider` works similarly to the other ServiceStack `IAuthWithRequest` providers where a 
successful API Key initializes the current `IRequest` with the user's Authenticated Session. It also adds the 
[ApiKey](https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack/blob/c4a8f9741e496793d949c09cecb84e84fca86686/src/ServiceStack/Auth/ApiKeyAuthProvider.cs#L31)
POCO Model to the request which can be accessed with:

```csharp
ApiKey apiKey = req.GetApiKey();
```

The `ApiKey` can be later inspected throughout the 
[request pipeline](https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack/wiki/Order-of-Operations) 
to determine which API Key, Type and Environment was used.

#### Interoperable

Using existing HTTP Functionality makes it simple and interoperable to use with any HTTP Client even 
command-line clients like curl where API Keys can be specified in the **Username** of HTTP Basic Auth:

> curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/charges -u yDOr26HsxyhpuRB3qbG07qfCmDhqutnA:

Or as a HTTP Bearer Token in the **Authorization** HTTP Request Header:

> curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/charges -H "Authorization: Bearer yDOr26HsxyhpuRB3qbG07qfCmDhqutnA"
 
Both of these methods are built into most HTTP Clients. Here are a few different ways which you can 
send them using ServiceStack's [.NET Service Clients](https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack/wiki/C%23-client):

```csharp
var client = new JsonServiceClient(baseUrl) {
    Credentials = new NetworkCredential(apiKey, "")
};

var client = new JsonHttpClient(baseUrl) {
    BearerToken = apiKey
};
```

Or using the [HTTP Utils](https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack/wiki/Http-Utils) extension methods:

```csharp
var response = baseUrl.CombineWith("/secured").GetStringFromUrl(
    requestFilter: req => req.AddBasicAuth(apiKey, ""));
    
var response = await "https://example.org/secured".GetJsonFromUrlAsync(
    requestFilter: req => req.AddBearerToken(apiKey));
```

#### Multiple Auth Repositories

The necessary functionality to support API Keys has been implemented in the following supported 
Auth Repositories:

 - `OrmLiteAuthRepository` - Supporting [most major RDBMS](https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack.OrmLite#8-flavours-of-ormlite-is-on-nuget)
 - `RedisAuthRepository` - Uses Redis back-end data store
 - `DynamoDbAuthRepository` - Uses AWS DynamoDB data store
 - `InMemoryAuthRepository` - Uses InMemory Auth Repository

And requires no additional configuration as it just utilizes the existing registered `IAuthRepository`.

#### Multiple API Key Types and Environments

You can specify any number of different Key Types for use in multiple environments for each user. Keys are 
generated upon User Registration where it generates both a **live** and **test** key for the **secret** 
Key Type by default. To also create both a "secret" and "publishable" API Key, configure it with:

```csharp
Plugins.Add(new AuthFeature(...,
    new IAuthProvider[] {
        new ApiKeyAuthProvider(AppSettings) {
            KeyTypes = new[] { "secret", "publishable" },
        }
    });
```

If preferred, any of the API Key Provider options can instead be specified in 
[App Settings](https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack/wiki/AppSettings) following the 
`apikey.{PropertyName}` format, e.g:

```xml
<add key="apikey.KeyTypes" value="secret,publishable" />
```

#### Multitenancy

Thanks to the ServiceStack's trivial support for enabling 
[Multitenancy](https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack/wiki/Multitenancy), the minimal configuration 
required to register and API Key Auth Provider that persists to a **LiveDb** SQL Server database and also 
allows Services called with an Test API Key to query the alternative **TestDb** database instead, is just:

```csharp
class AppHost : AppSelfHostBase
{
    public AppHost() : base("API Key Multitenancy Example", typeof(AppHost).Assembly) { }

    public override void Configure(Container container)
    {
        //Create and register an OrmLite DB Factory configured to use Live DB by default 
        var dbFactory = new OrmLiteConnectionFactory(
            AppSettings.GetString("LiveDb"), SqlServerDialect.Provider);

        container.Register<IDbConnectionFactory>(dbFactory);

        // Register a "TestDb" Named Connection 
        dbFactory.RegisterConnection("TestDb", 
            AppSettings.GetString("TestDb"), SqlServerDialect.Provider);

        //Tell ServiceStack you want to persist User Auth Info in SQL Server
        container.Register<IAuthRepository>(c => new OrmLiteAuthRepository(dbFactory));
        
        //Register the AuthFeature with the API Key Auth Provider 
        Plugins.Add(new AuthFeature(() => new AuthUserSession(),
            new IAuthProvider[] {
                new ApiKeyAuthProvider(AppSettings)
            });
    }
    
    public override IDbConnection GetDbConnection(IRequest req = null)
    {
        //If an API Test Key was used return DB connection to TestDb instead: 
        return req.GetApiKey()?.Environment == "test"
            ? TryResolve<IDbConnectionFactory>().OpenDbConnection("TestDb")
            : base.GetDbConnection(req);
    }
}
```

Now whenever a Test API Key was used to call an Authenticated Service, all `base.Db` Queries or 
AutoQuery Services will query **TestDb** instead.

### API Key Defaults

The API Key Auth Provider has several options to customize its behavior with all but delegate Filters
being able to be specified in AppSettings as well:

```csharp
new ApiKeyAuthProvider 
{
    // Whether to only permit access via API Key from a secure connection. (default true)
    public bool RequireSecureConnection { get; set; }

    // Generate different keys for different environments. (default live,test)
    public string[] Environments { get; set; }

    // Different types of Keys each user can have. (default secret)
    public string[] KeyTypes { get; set; }

    // How much entropy should the generated keys have. (default 24)
    public int KeySizeBytes { get; set; }

    /// Whether to automatically expire keys. (default no expiry)
    public TimeSpan? ExpireKeysAfter { get; set; }

    // Automatically create the ApiKey Table for Auth Repositories which need it. (default true)
    public bool InitSchema { get; set; }

    // Change how API Key is generated
    public CreateApiKeyDelegate GenerateApiKey { get; set; }

    // Run custom filter after API Key is created
    public Action<ApiKey> CreateApiKeyFilter { get; set; }
}
```

Should you need to, you can access API Keys from the Auth Repository directly through the following interface:

```csharp
public interface IManageApiKeys
{
    void InitApiKeySchema();

    bool ApiKeyExists(string apiKey);

    ApiKey GetApiKey(string apiKey);

    List<ApiKey> GetUserApiKeys(string userId);

    void StoreAll(IEnumerable<ApiKey> apiKeys);
}
```

> This interface also defines what's required in order to implement API Keys support on a Custom AuthRepository.

For Auth Repositories which implement it, you can access the interface by resolving `IAuthRepository` from
the IOC and casting it to the above interface, e.g:

```csharp
var apiRepo = (IManageApiKeys)HostContext.TryResolve<IAuthRepository>();
var apiKeys = apiRepo.GetUserApiKeys(session.UserAuthId);
```

### Built-in API Key Services

To give end-users access to their keys the API Key Auth Provider enables 2 Services: the `GetApiKeys` 
Service to return all valid User API Keys for the specified environment:

```csharp
//GET /apikeys/live
var response = client.Get(new GetApiKeys { Environment = "live" }); 
response.Results.PrintDump(); //User's "live" API Keys 
```

And the `RegenrateApiKeys` Service to invalidate all current API Keys and generate new ones for the 
specified environment:

```csharp
//POST /apikeys/regenerate/live
var response = client.Post(new RegenrateApiKeys { Environment = "live" }); 
response.Results.PrintDump(); //User's new "live" API Keys 
```

You can modify which built-in Services you want registered, or modify the custom routes to where you
want them to be available by modifying the `ServiceRoutes` collection. E.g. you can prevent it from 
registering any Services by setting `ServiceRoutes` to an empty collection:

```csharp
new ApiKeyAuthProvider { ServiceRoutes = new Dictionary<Type, string[]>() }
```

## JWT Auth Provider

Even more exciting than the new API Key Provider is the new integrated Auth solution for the popular
[JSON Web Tokens](https://jwt.io/) (JWT) industry standard which is easily enabled by registering
the `JwtAuthProvider` with the `AuthFeature` plugin:

```csharp
Plugins.Add(new AuthFeature(...,
    new IAuthProvider[] {
        new JwtAuthProvider(AppSettings) { AuthKey = AesUtils.CreateKey() },
        new CredentialsAuthProvider(AppSettings),
        //...
    }));
```

At a minimum you'll need to specify the `AuthKey` that will be used to Sign and Verify JWT tokens.
Whilst creating a new one in memory as above will work, a new Auth Key will be created every time the 
AppDomain recycles which will invalidate all existing JWT Tokens created with the previous key. 

So you'll typically want to generate the AuthKey out-of-band and configure it with the `JwtAuthProvider` at
registration which you can do in code using any of the [AppSettings providers](https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack/wiki/AppSettings):

```csharp
new JwtAuthProvider(AppSettings) { AuthKeyBase64 = AppSettings.GetString("AuthKeyBase64") }
```

Or alternatively you can configure most `JwtAuthProvider` properties in your **Web.config** `<appSettings/>` 
(default AppSettings Provider) following the `jwt.{PropertyName}` format:

```xml
<add key="jwt.AuthKeyBase64" value="{Base64AuthKey}" />
```

As with all crypto keys you'll want to keep them confidential as if anyone gets a hold of your AuthKey 
they'll be able to forge and sign their own JWT tokens letting them be able to impersonate any user, 
roles or permissions!

#### RequireSecureConnection

Both API Key and JWT Auth Providers defaults to `RequireSecureConnection=true` which mandates for
Authentication via either Provider to happen over a secure (HTTPS) connection as both bearer tokens should 
be kept highly confidential. You can specify `RequireSecureConnection=false` to disable this requirement 
for testing or within controlled internal environments.

### Sending JWT with Service Clients

Just like API Keys, JWT Tokens can be sent using the Bearer Token support in all HTTP and Service Clients:

```csharp
var client = new JsonServiceClient(baseUrl) {
    BearerToken = jwtToken
};

var response = await "https://example.org/secured".GetJsonFromUrlAsync(
    requestFilter: req => req.AddBearerToken(jwtToken));
```

The Service Clients offer additional high-level functionality where it's able to transparently request 
a new JWT Token after it expires by handling when the configured JWT Token becomes invalidated in the 
`OnAuthenticationRequired` callback. Here we can retrieve a new JWT Token that we can fetch using a 
different Service Client accessing a centralized and independent Auth Microservice that's configured with 
both API Key and JWT Token Auth Providers. We can fetch a new JWT Token by calling ServiceStack's 
built-in `Authenticate` Service with our **secret** API Key (that by default never invalidates unless revoked).

If authenticated, sending an empty `Authenticate()` DTO will return the currently Authenticated User Info 
that also generates a new JWT Token from the User's Authenticated Session and returns it in the `BearerToken` 
Response DTO property which we can use to update our invalidated JWT Token.

All together we can configure our Service Client to transparently refresh expired JWT Tokens with just:

```csharp
var authClient = JsonServiceClient(centralAuthBaseUrl) {
    Credentials = new NetworkCredential(apiKey, "")
};

var client = new JsonServiceClient(baseUrl);
client.OnAuthenticationRequired = () => {
    client.BearerToken = authClient.Send(new Authenticate()).BearerToken;
};
```

#### Sending JWT using Cookies

To [improve accessibility with Ajax clients](https://stormpath.com/blog/where-to-store-your-jwts-cookies-vs-html5-web-storage)
JWT Tokens can also be sent using the `ss-tok` Cookie, e.g:

```csharp
var client = new JsonServiceClient(baseUrl);
client.SetCookie("ss-tok", jwtToken);
```

We'll walk through an example of how you can access JWT Tokens as well as how you can convert Authenticated
Sessions into JWT Tokens and assign it to use a **Secure** and **HttpOnly** Cookie later on.

### JWT Overview

A nice property of JWT tokens is that they allow for truly stateless authentication where API Keys and user 
credentials can be maintained in a decentralized Auth Service that's kept isolated from the rest of your 
System, making them optimal for use in Microservice architectures.

Being self-contained lends JWT tokens to more scalable, performant and flexible architectures as they don't 
require any I/O or any state to be accessed from App Servers to validate the JWT Tokens, this is unlike all 
other Auth Providers which requires at least a DB, Cache or Network hit to authenticate the user.

A good introduction into JWT is availble from the JWT website: https://jwt.io/introduction/

Essentially JWT's consist of 3 parts separated by `.` with each part encoded in 
[Base64url Encoding](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4648#section-5) making it safe to encode both text and
binary using only URL-safe (i.e. non-escaping required) chars in the following format:

    Base64UrlHeader.Base64UrlPayload.Base64UrlSignature 

Where just like the API Key, JWT's can be sent as a Bearer Token in the `Authorization` HTTP Request Header.

### JWT Header

The header typically consists of two parts: the type of the token and the hashing algorithm being used 
which is typically just:

```json
{
  "alg": "HS256",
  "typ": "JWT"
}
```

We also send the "kid" [Key Id](http://self-issued.info/docs/draft-jones-json-web-token-01.html#rfc.section.5.1)
used to identify which key should be used to validate the signature to help with seamless key rotations in 
future. If not specified the KeyId defaults to the **first 3 chars** of the Base64 HMAC or RSA Public Key Modulus.

### JWT Payload

The Payload contains the essential information of a JWT Token which is made up of "claims", i.e. 
statements and metadata about a user which are categorized into 3 groups: 

 - [Registered Claim Names](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519#section-4.1) - containing a known set of 
reserved names predefined in the JWT Standard
 - [Public Claim Names](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519#section-4.2) - additional common names that are
 registered in the [IANA "JSON Web Token Claims" registry](http://www.iana.org/assignments/jwt/jwt.xhtml) or
 otherwise adopt a Collision-Resistant name, e.g. prefixed by a namespace
 - [Private Claim Names](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519#section-4.3) - any other metadata you wish to
 include about an entity

We use the Payload to store essential information about the user which we use to validate the token and 
populate the session. Which typically contains:

 - **iss** ([Issuer](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519#section-4.1.1)) - the principal that issued the
 JWT. Can be set with `JwtAuthProvider.Issuer`, defaults to **ssjwt**
 - **sub** ([Subject](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519#section-4.1.2)) - identifies the subject of 
 the JWT, used to store the User's **UserAuthId**
 - **iat** ([Issued At](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519#section-4.1.6)) - when JWT Token was issued.
 Can use `InvalidateTokensIssuedBefore` to invalidate tokens issued before a specific date
 - **exp** ([Expiration Time](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519#section-4.1.4)) - when the JWT expires. 
 Initialized with `JwtAuthProvider.ExpireTokensIn` from date of issue (default **14 days**)
 - **aud** ([Audience](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519#section-4.1.3)) - identifies the recipient of
 the JWT. Can be set with `JwtAuthProvider.Audience`, defaults to `null` (Optional)

The remaining information in the JWT Payload is used to populate the Users Session, to maximize interoperability
we've used the most appropriate [Public Claim Names](http://www.iana.org/assignments/jwt/jwt.xhtml) 
where possible:

 - **email** <- `session.Email`
 - **given_name** <- `session.FirstName`
 - **family_name** <- `session.LastName`
 - **name** <- `session.DisplayName`
 - **preferred_username** <- `session.UserName`
 - **picture** <- `session.ProfileUrl`

We also need to capture Users Roles and Permissions but as there's no Public Claim Name for this yet we're using 
[Azure's Active Directory Conventions](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/active-directory-token-and-claims/)
where User Roles are stored in **roles** as a JSON Array and similarly, Permissions are stored in **perms**.

To keep the JWT Token small we're only storing the essential User Info above in the Token, which means when
the Token is restored it will only be partially populated. You can detect when a Session was partially 
populated from a JWT Token with the new `FromToken` boolean property.

#### Modifying the Payload

Whilst only limited info is embedded in the payload by default, all matching 
[AuthUserSession](https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack/blob/master/src/ServiceStack/AuthUserSession.cs)
properties embedded in the token will also be populated on the Session, which you can add to the payload 
using the `CreatePayloadFilter` delegate. So if you also want to have access to when the user was registered 
you can add it to the payload with:

```csharp
new JwtAuthProvider(AppSettings) 
{
    CreatePayloadFilter = (payload,session) => 
        payload["CreatedAt"] = session.CreatedAt.ToUnixTime().ToString()
}
```

You can also use the filter to modify any existing property which you can use to change the behavior of the
JWT Token, e.g. we can add a special exception extending the JWT Expiration to all Users from Acme Inc with:

```csharp
new JwtAuthProvider(AppSettings) 
{
    CreatePayloadFilter = (payload,session) => {
        if (session.Email.EndsWith("@acme.com")) 
            payload["exp"] = DateTime.UtcNow.AddYears(1).ToUnixTime().ToString();
    }
}
```

Likewise you can modify JWT Headers with the `CreateHeaderFilter` delegate and modify how the Users Session
is populated with the `PopulateSessionFilter`.

### JWT Signature

JWT Tokens are possible courtesy of the cryptographic signature added to the end of the message that's used 
to Authenticate and Verify that a Message hasn't been tampered with. As long as the message signature 
validates with our `AuthKey` we can be certain the contents of the message haven't changed from when it was 
created by either ourselves or someone else with access to our AuthKey.

JWT standard allows for a number of different Hashing Algorithms although requires at least the **HM256** 
HMAC SHA-256 to be supported which is the default. The full list of Symmetric HMAC and Asymmetric RSA
Algorithms `JwtAuthProvider` supports include:

 - **HM256** - Symmetric HMAC SHA-256 algorithm
 - **HS384** - Symmetric HMAC SHA-384 algorithm
 - **HS512** - Symmetric HMAC SHA-512 algorithm
 - **RS256** - Asymmetric RSA with PKCS#1 padding with SHA-256
 - **RS384** - Asymmetric RSA with PKCS#1 padding with SHA-384
 - **RS512** - Asymmetric RSA with PKCS#1 padding with SHA-512

HMAC is the simplest to use as it lets you use the same AuthKey to Sign and Verify the message. 

But if preferred you can use a RSA Keys to sign and verify tokens by changing the `HashAlgorithm` and 
specifying a RSA Private Key:

```csharp
new JwtAuthProvider(AppSettings) { 
    HashAlgorithm = "RS256",
    PrivateKeyXml = AppSettings.GetString("PrivateKeyXml") 
}
```

If you don't have a RSA Private Key, one can be created with:

```csharp
var privateKey = RsaUtils.CreatePrivateKeyParams(RsaKeyLengths.Bit2048);
```

And its public key can be extracted using `ToPublicRsaParameters()` extension method, e.g:

```csharp
var publicKey = privateKey.ToPublicRsaParameters();
```

Then to serialize RSA Keys, you can then export them to XML with:

```csharp
var privateKeyXml = privateKey.ToPrivateKeyXml()
var publicKeyXml = privateKey.ToPublicKeyXml();
```

The behavior of using RSA to sign the JWT Tokens is mostly transparent but instead of using the AuthKey to 
both Sign and Verify the JWT Payload, it's signed with the Private Key and verified using the Public Key.
New tokens will also have the **alg** JWT Header set to **RS256** to reflect the new HashAlgorithm used.

### Encrypted JWE Tokens

Something that's not immediately obvious is that while JWT Tokens are signed to prevent tampering and 
verify authenticity, they're not encrypted and can easily be read by decoding the URL-safe Base64 string.
This is a feature of JWT where it allows Client Apps to inspect the User's claims and hide functionality
they don't have access to, it also means that JWT Tokens are debuggable and can be inspected for whenever 
you need to track down unexpected behavior.

But there may be times when you want to embed sensitive information in your JWT Tokens in which case you'll
want to enable Encryption, which can be done with:

```csharp
new JwtAuthProvider(AppSettings) { 
    PrivateKeyXml = AppSettings.GetString("PrivateKeyXml"),
    EncryptPayload = true
}
```

When turning on encryption, tokens are instead created following the
[JSON Web Encryption (JWE)](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7516#section-3) standard where they'll be
encoded in the 5-part [JWE Compact Serialization](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7516#section-3.1) format:

    BASE64URL(UTF8(JWE Protected Header)) || '.' ||
    BASE64URL(JWE Encrypted Key)          || '.' ||
    BASE64URL(JWE Initialization Vector)  || '.' ||
    BASE64URL(JWE Ciphertext)             || '.' ||
    BASE64URL(JWE Authentication Tag)

JwtAuthProvider's JWE implementation uses RSAES OAEP for Key Encryption and AES/128/CBC HMAC SHA256 for
Content Encryption, closely following 
[JWE's AES_128_CBC_HMAC_SHA_256 Example](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7516#appendix-A.2)
where a new MAC Auth and AES Crypt Key and IV are created for each Token. The Content Encryption Key (CEK) 
used to Encrypt and Authenticate the payload is encrypted using the Public Key and decrypted with the 
Private Key so only Systems with access to the Private Key will be able to Decrypt, Validate and Read 
the Token's payload.

### Stateless Auth Microservices

One of JWT's most appealing features is its ability to decouple the System that provides User Authentication 
Services and issues tokens from all the other Systems but are still able provide protected Services although 
no longer needs access to a User database or Session data store to facilitate it, as sessions can now be 
embedded in Tokens and its state maintained and sent by clients instead of accessed from each App Server. 
This is ideal for Microservice architectures where Auth Services can be isolated into a single 
externalized System.

With this use-case in mind we've decoupled `JwtAuthProvider` in 2 classes:

 - [JwtAuthProviderReader](https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack/blob/master/src/ServiceStack/Auth/JwtAuthProviderReader.cs) - 
Responsible for validating and creating Authenticated User Sessions from tokens
 - [JwtAuthProvider](https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack/blob/master/src/ServiceStack/Auth/JwtAuthProvider.cs) -
Inherits `JwtAuthProviderReader` to also be able to Issue, Encrypt and provide access to tokens

#### Services only Validating Tokens

This lets us configure our Microservices that we want to enable Authentication via JWT Tokens down to just:

```csharp
public override void Configure(Container container)
{
    Plugins.Add(new AuthFeature(() => new AuthUserSession(),
        new IAuthProvider[] {
            new JwtAuthProviderReader(AppSettings) {
                HashAlgorithm = "RS256",
                PublicKeyXml = AppSettings.GetString("PublicKeyXml")
            },
        }));
}
```

Which no longer needs access to a 
[IUserAuthRepository](https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack/wiki/Authentication-and-authorization#userauth-persistence---the-iuserauthrepository)
or [Sessions](https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack/wiki/Sessions) since they're populated entirely
from JWT Tokens. Whilst you can use the default **HS256** HashAlgorithm, RSA is ideal for this use-case
as you can limit access to the **PrivateKey** to only the central Auth Service issuing the tokens and then 
only distribute the **PublicKey** to each Service which needs to validate them.

#### Service Issuing Tokens

As we can now contain all our Systems Auth Functionality to a single System we can open it up to support 
multiple Auth Providers as it only needs to be maintained in a central location but is still able to 
benefit all our Microservices that are only configured to validate JWT Tokens.

Here's a popular Auth Server configuration example which stores all User Auth information as well as
User Sessions in SQL Server and is configured to support many of ServiceStack's Auth and OAuth providers:

```csharp
public override void Configure(Container container)
{
    //Store UserAuth in SQL Server
    var dbFactory = new OrmLiteConnectionFactory(
        AppSettings.GetString("LiveDb"), SqlServerDialect.Provider);
        
    container.Register<IDbConnectionFactory>(dbFactory);
    container.Register<IAuthRepository>(c =>
        new OrmLiteAuthRepository(dbFactory) { UseDistinctRoleTables = true });

    //Create UserAuth RDBMS Tables
    container.Resolve<IAuthRepository>().InitSchema();

    //Also store User Sessions in SQL Server
    container.RegisterAs<OrmLiteCacheClient, ICacheClient>();
    container.Resolve<ICacheClient>().InitSchema();
    
    //Add Support for 
    Plugins.Add(new AuthFeature(() => new AuthUserSession(),
        new IAuthProvider[] {
            new JwtAuthProvider(AppSettings) {
                HashAlgorithm = "RS256",
                PrivateKeyXml = AppSettings.GetString("PrivateKeyXml")
            },
            new ApiKeyAuthProvider(AppSettings),        //Sign-in with API Key
            new CredentialsAuthProvider(),              //Sign-in with UserName/Password credentials
            new BasicAuthProvider(),                    //Sign-in with HTTP Basic Auth
            new DigestAuthProvider(AppSettings),        //Sign-in with HTTP Digest Auth
            new TwitterAuthProvider(AppSettings),       //Sign-in with Twitter
            new FacebookAuthProvider(AppSettings),      //Sign-in with Facebook
            new YahooOpenIdOAuthProvider(AppSettings),  //Sign-in with Yahoo OpenId
            new OpenIdOAuthProvider(AppSettings),       //Sign-in with Custom OpenId
            new GoogleOAuth2Provider(AppSettings),      //Sign-in with Google OAuth2 Provider
            new LinkedInOAuth2Provider(AppSettings),    //Sign-in with LinkedIn OAuth2 Provider
            new GithubAuthProvider(AppSettings),        //Sign-in with GitHub OAuth Provider
            new YandexAuthProvider(AppSettings),        //Sign-in with Yandex OAuth Provider        
            new VkAuthProvider(AppSettings),            //Sign-in with VK.com OAuth Provider 
        }));
}
```

With this setup we can Authenticate using any of the supported Auth Providers with our central Auth Server,
retrieve the generated Token and use it to communicate with any our Microservices configured to 
validate tokens:

#### Retrieve Token with API Key 

```csharp
var authClient = JsonServiceClient(centralAuthBaseUrl) {
    Credentials = new NetworkCredential(apiKey, "")
};

var jwtToken = authClient.Send(new Authenticate()).BearerToken;

var client = new JsonServiceClient(service1BaseUrl) { BearerToken = jwtToken };
var response = client.Get(new Secured { ... });
```

#### Retrieve Token with HTTP Basic Auth

```csharp
var authClient = JsonServiceClient(centralAuthBaseUrl) {
    Credentials = new NetworkCredential(username, password)
};

var jwtToken = authClient.Send(new Authenticate()).BearerToken;
```

#### Retrieve Token with Credentials Auth

```csharp
var authClient = JsonServiceClient(centralAuthBaseUrl);

var jwtToken = authClient.Send(new Authenticate {
    provider = "credentials",
    UserName = username,
    Password = password
}).BearerToken;
```

### Convert Sessions to Tokens

Another useful Service that `JwtAuthProvider` provides is being able to Convert your current Authenticated
Session into a Token. Authenticating via Credentials Auth establishes an **Authenticated Session** with the
server which is captured in the 
[Session Cookies](https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack/wiki/Sessions#cookie-session-ids)
that gets populated on the HTTP Client. This lets us access protected Services immediately after we've
successfully Authenticated, e.g:

```csharp
var authResponse = client.Send(new Authenticate {
    provider = "credentials",
    UserName = username,
    Password = password
});

var response = client.Get(new Secured { ... });
```

However this only establishes an **Authenticated Session** to a single Server that only lasts until the
session stored on the Server is valid. The easiest way to tell ServiceStack to convert the Session into a
stateless JWT Cookie instead is to set the `UseTokenCookie` option when authenticating, e.g:

```csharp
var authResponse = client.Send(new Authenticate {
    provider = "credentials",
    UserName = username,
    Password = password,
    UseTokenCookie = true
});

//Uses stateless ss-tok Cookie with our Session encapsulated in JWT Token
var response = client.Get(new Secured { ... }); 
var jwtToken = client.GetTokenCookie(); //From ss-tok Cookie
```

This also removes the our Session from the App Servers Cache as now the Users **Authenticated Session** is
contained solely in the JWT Cookie and is valid until the JWT Cookies Expiration, instead of determined
by Server Session State.

Another way we can access our Token is to call the `ConvertSessionToToken` Service which also converts our 
currently Authenticated Session into a JWT Token which we can use instead to communicate with all our 
independent Services, e.g:

```csharp
var tokenResponse = client.Send(new ConvertSessionToToken());
var jwtToken = client.GetTokenCookie(); //From ss-tok Cookie

var client2 = new JsonServiceClient(service2BaseUrl) { BearerToken = jwtToken };
var response = client2.Get(new Secured2 { ... });

var client3 = new JsonServiceClient(service3BaseUrl) { BearerToken = jwtToken };
var response = client3.Get(new Secured3 { ... });
```

Tokens are returned in the Secure HttpOnly **ss-tok** Cookie, accessible from the `GetTokenCookie()` 
extension method as seen above.

The default behavior of `ConvertSessionToToken` is to remove the Current Session from the Auth Server 
which will prevent access to protected Services using our previously Authenticated Session. 
If you still want to preserve your existing Session you can indicate this with:

```csharp
var tokenResponse = client.Send(new ConvertSessionToToken { PreserveSession = true });
```

### Ajax Clients

Using Cookies is the 
[recommended way for using JWT Tokens in Web Applications](https://stormpath.com/blog/where-to-store-your-jwts-cookies-vs-html5-web-storage)
since the `HttpOnly` Cookie flag will prevent it from being accessible from JavaScript making them immune
to XSS attacks whilst the `Secure` flag will ensure that the JWT Token is only ever transmitted over HTTPS.

You can convert your Session into a Token and set the **ss-tok** Cookie in your web page by sending an Ajax 
request to `/session-to-token`, e.g:

```javascript
$.post("/session-to-token");
```

Likewise this API lets you convert Sessions created by any of the OAuth providers into a stateless JWT Token.

### Switching existing Sites to JWT

Thanks to the flexibility and benefits of using stateless JWT Tokens, we've upgraded both our Single Page App
http://techstacks.io which uses Twitter and GitHub OAuth to [use JWT with a single Ajax call](https://github.com/ServiceStackApps/TechStacks/blob/78ecd5e390e585c14f616bb27b24e0072b756040/src/TechStacks/TechStacks/js/user/services.js#L30):

```javascript
$.post("/session-to-token");
```

We've also upgraded https://servicestack.net which as it uses normal Username/Password Credentials Authentication 
(i.e. instead of redirects in OAuth), it doesn't need any additional network calls as we can add the `UseTokenCookie`
option as a hidden variable in our FORM request:

```html
<form id="form-login" action="/auth/login">
    <input type="hidden" name="UseTokenCookie" value="true" />
    ...
</form>
```

Which just like `ConvertSessionToToken` returns a populated session in the **ss-tok** Cookie so now 
both [techstacks.io](http://techstacks.io) and [servicestack.net](https://servicestack.net) can maintain 
uninterrupted Sessions across multiple redeployments without a persistent Sessions cache.

### JWT Configuration

The JWT Auth Provider provides the following options to customize its behavior: 

```csharp
class JwtAuthProviderReader
{
    // The RSA Bit Key Length to use
    static RsaKeyLengths UseRsaKeyLength = RsaKeyLengths.Bit2048

    // Different HMAC Algorithms supported
    Dictionary<string, Func<byte[], byte[], byte[]>> HmacAlgorithms

    // Different RSA Signing Algorithms supported
    Dictionary<string, Func<RSAParameters, byte[], byte[]>> RsaSignAlgorithms
    Dictionary<string, Func<RSAParameters, byte[], byte[], bool>> RsaVerifyAlgorithms

    // Whether to only allow access via API Key from a secure connection. (default true)
    bool RequireSecureConnection

    // Run custom filter after JWT Header is created
    Action<JsonObject, IAuthSession> CreateHeaderFilter

    // Run custom filter after JWT Payload is created
    Action<JsonObject, IAuthSession> CreatePayloadFilter

    // Run custom filter after session is restored from a JWT Token
    Action<IAuthSession, JsonObject, IRequest> PopulateSessionFilter

    // Whether to encrypt JWE Payload (default false). 
    // Uses RSA-OAEP for Key Encryption and AES/128/CBC HMAC SHA256 for Conent Encryption
    bool EncryptPayload

    // Which Hash Algorithm should be used to sign the JWT Token. (default HS256)
    string HashAlgorithm

    // Whether to only allow processing of JWT Tokens using the configured HashAlgorithm. (default true)
    bool RequireHashAlgorithm

    // The Issuer to embed in the token. (default ssjwt)
    string Issuer

    // The Audience to embed in the token. (default null)
    string Audience

    // What Id to use to identify the Key used to sign the token. (default First 3 chars of Base64 Key)
    string KeyId

    // The AuthKey used to sign the JWT Token
    byte[] AuthKey
    // Convenient overload to initialize AuthKey with Base64 string
    string AuthKeyBase64

    // The RSA Private Key used to Sign the JWT Token when RSA is used
    RSAParameters? PrivateKey
    // Convenient overload to intialize the Private Key via exported XML
    string PrivateKeyXml

    // The RSA Public Key used to Verify the JWT Token when RSA is used
    RSAParameters? PublicKey

    // Convenient overload to intialize the Public Key via exported XML
    string PublicKeyXml

    // How long should JWT Tokens be valid for. (default 14 days)
    TimeSpan ExpireTokensIn

    // Whether to invalidate all JWT Tokens issued before a specified date.
    DateTime? InvalidateTokensIssuedBefore

    // Modify the registration of ConvertSessionToToken Service
    Dictionary<Type, string[]> ServiceRoutes
}
```

### Further Examples

More examples of both the new API Key and JWT Auth Providers are available in 
[StatelessAuthTests](https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack/blob/master/tests/RazorRockstars.Console.Files/StatelessAuthTests.cs).

## OrmLite

### Cleaner, Modernized API Surface

As [mentioned in the last release](https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack/blob/master/docs/2016/release-notes.md#deprecating-legacy-ormlite-apis) 
we've moved OrmLite's deprecated APIs into the `ServiceStack.OrmLite.Legacy` namespace leaving a clean, modern 
API surface in OrmLite's default namespace.

This primarily affects the original OrmLite APIs ending with `*Fmt` which were used to provide a familiar 
API for C# developers based on C#'s `string.Format()`, e.g:

```csharp
var tracks = db.SelectFmt<Track>("Artist = {0} AND Album = {1}", "Nirvana", "Nevermind");
```

Whilst you can continue using the legacy API by adding the `ServiceStack.OrmLite.Legacy` namespace, it's also 
a good time to consider switching using any of the recommended parameterized APIs below:

```csharp
var tracks = db.Select<Track>(x => x.Artist == "Nirvana" && x.Album == "Nevermind");

var q = db.From<Track>()
    .Where(x => x.Artist == "Nirvana" && x.Album == "Nevermind");
var tracks = db.Select(q);

var tracks = db.Select<Track>("Artist = @artist AND Album = @album", 
    new { artist = "Nirvana", album = "Nevermind" });

var tracks = db.SqlList<Track>(
    "SELECT * FROM Track WHERE Artist = @artist AND Album = @album",
    new { artist = "Nirvana", album = "Nevermind" });
```

The other API's that have been moved are those that inject an `SqlExpression<T>`, e.g:

```csharp
var tracks = db.Select<Track>(q => 
    q.Where(x => x.Artist == "Nirvana" && x.Album == "Nevermind"));
```

This overload would confuse intellisense where lambda's could be injected with either `T` or 
`SqlExpression<T>`. We've now removed the `SqlExpression<T>` overloads so now the only typed POCO parameter 
is injected. Existing APIs can use `db.From<T>()` to resolve any build errors, e.g: 

```csharp
var tracks = db.Select(db.From<Track>()
    .Where(x => x.Artist == "Nirvana" && x.Album == "Nevermind"));
```

### Parameterized by default

The `OrmLiteConfig.UseParameterizeSqlExpressions` option that could be used to disable parameterized 
SqlExpressions and revert to using in-line escaped SQL has been removed in along with all its dependent 
functionality, so now all queries just use db params.

### Improved partial Updates and Inserts APIs

One of the limitations we had with using LINQ Expressions was the
[lack of support for assignment expressions](http://stackoverflow.com/a/16847364/85785) which meant we
previously needed to do capture which fields you wanted updated in partial updates, e.g:

```csharp
db.UpdateOnly(new Poco { Age = 22 }, onlyFields:p => p.Age, where:p => p.Name == "Justin Bieber");

//increments age by 1
db.UpdateAdd(new Poco { Age = 1 }, onlyFields:p => p.Age, where:p => p.Name == "Justin Bieber");
```

Taking a [leaf from PocoDynamo](https://github.com/ServiceStack/PocoDynamo#updating-an-item-with-pocodynamo)
we've added a better API using a lambda expression which now saves us from having to specify which fields
to update twice since we're able to infer them from the returned Member Init Expression, e.g:

```csharp
db.UpdateOnly(() => new Poco { Age = 22 }, where: p => p.Name == "Justin Bieber");

//increments age by 1
db.UpdateAdd(() => new Poco { Age = 1 }, where: p => p.Name == "Justin Bieber");
```

Like most API's, async equivalents are also available:

```csharp
await db.UpdateOnlyAsync(() => new Poco { Age = 22 }, where: p => p.Name == "Justin Bieber");
await db.UpdateOnlyAsync(() => new Poco { Age = 1 }, where: p => p.Name == "Justin Bieber");
```

Likewise we've extended this feature to partial INSERT's as well:

```csharp
db.InsertOnly(() => new Poco { Name = "Justin Bieber", Age = 22 });

await db.InsertOnlyAsync(() => new Poco { Name = "Justin Bieber", Age = 22 });
```

### New ColumnExists API

We've added support for a Typed `ColumnExists` API across all supported RDBMS's which makes it easy to
inspect the state of an RDBMS Table which can be used to determine what modifications you want on it, e.g:

```csharp
class Poco 
{
    public int Id { get; set; }
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public string Ssn { get; set; }
}

db.DropTable<Poco>();
db.TableExists<Poco>(); //= false

db.CreateTable<Poco>(); 
db.TableExists<Poco>(); //= true

db.ColumnExists<Poco>(x => x.Ssn); //= true
db.DropColumn<Poco>(x => x.Ssn);
db.ColumnExists<Poco>(x => x.Ssn); //= false
```

In a future version of your Table POCO you can use `ColumnExists` to detect which columns haven't been 
added yet, then use `AddColumn` to add it, e.g:

```csharp
class Poco 
{
    public int Id { get; set; }
    public string Name { get; set; }

    [Default(0)]
    public int Age { get; set; }
}

if (!db.ColumnExists<Poco>(x => x.Age)) //= false
    db.AddColumn<Poco>(x => x.Age);

db.ColumnExists<Poco>(x => x.Age); //= true
```

The `[Default]` attribute lets you specify a default value, required when adding non-nullable columns to
a table with existing rows.

### New SelectMulti API

Previously the only Typed API available to select data across multiple joined tables was to use a 
[Custom POCO with all the columns](https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack.OrmLite#selecting-multiple-columns-across-joined-tables) 
you want from any of the joined tables, e.g:

```
List<FullCustomerInfo> customers = db.Select<FullCustomerInfo>(
    db.From<Customer>().Join<CustomerAddress>());
```

The new `SelectMulti` API now lets you use your existing POCO's to access results from multiple joined tables 
by returning them in a Typed Tuple:

```csharp
var q = db.From<Customer>()
    .Join<Customer, CustomerAddress>()
    .Join<Customer, Order>()
    .Where(x => x.CreatedDate >= new DateTime(2016,01,01))
    .And<CustomerAddress>(x => x.Country == "Australia");

var results = db.SelectMulti<Customer, CustomerAddress, Order>(q);

foreach (var tuple in results)
{
    Customer customer = tuple.Item1;
    CustomerAddress custAddress = tuple.Item2;
    Order custOrder = tuple.Item3;
}
```

#### Using OrmLite with Dapper

One of the benefits of Micro ORM's is that they can be used together, so alternatively you could use a 
combination of OrmLite to create the typed query using its built-in Reference Conventions and then use 
OrmLite's embedded version of 
[Dapper to Query Multiple result-sets](http://stackoverflow.com/a/37420341/85785) into your existing POCOs:

```csharp
var q = db.From<Customer>()
    .Join<Customer, CustomerAddress>()
    .Join<Customer, Order>()
    .Where(x => x.CreatedDate >= new DateTime(2016,01,01))
    .And<CustomerAddress>(x => x.Country == "Australia")
    .Select("*");

using (var multi = db.QueryMultiple(q.ToSelectStatement()))
{
    var results = multi.Read<Customer, CustomerAddress, Order, 
        Tuple<Customer,CustomerAddress,Order>>(Tuple.Create).ToList();

    foreach (var tuple in results)
    {
        Customer customer = tuple.Item1;
        CustomerAddress custAddress = tuple.Item2;
        Order custOrder = tuple.Item3;
    }
}
```

### Multiple APIs to fetch data

One of the benefits of OrmLite is how the query is constructed and executed is independent from how the 
results are mapped. So it doesn't matter whether the query used raw custom SQL or a Typed SQL Expression, 
OrmLite just looks at the dataset returned to workout how the results should be mapped. This allows you
to use any of the [loose-typed Convenience APIs](http://stackoverflow.com/a/37443162/85785) to fetch
data from multiple joined tables. In addition to using 
[untyped .NET Collections](https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack.OrmLite#dynamic-result-sets), we've
also now added support for `Select<dynamic>` as well:

```csharp
var q = db.From<Employee>()
    .Join<Department>()
    .Select<Employee, Department>((e, d) => new { e.FirstName, e.LastName, d.Name });
    
List<dynamic> results = db.Select<dynamic>(q);

foreach (dynamic result in results)
{
    string firstName = result.FirstName;
    string lastName = result.LastName;
    string deptName = result.Name;
}
```

### CustomSelect Attribute

The new `[CustomSelect]` can be used to define properties you want populated from a Custom SQL Function or 
Expression instead of a normal persisted column, e.g:

```csharp
public class Block
{
    public int Id { get; set; }
    public int Width { get; set; }
    public int Height { get; set; }

    [CustomSelect("Width * Height")]
    public int Area { get; set; }

    [Default(OrmLiteVariables.SystemUtc)]
    public DateTime CreatedDate { get; set; }

    [CustomSelect("FORMAT(CreatedDate, 'yyyy-MM-dd')")]
    public string DateFormat { get; set; }
}

db.Insert(new Block { Id = 1, Width = 10, Height = 5 });

var block = db.SingleById<Block>(1);

block.Area.Print(); //= 50

block.DateFormat.Print(); //= 2016-06-08
```

### OrmLiteAuthRepository

OrmLiteAuthRepository can now be configured to store User Auth data in a separate database with:

```csharp
container.Register<IAuthRepository>(c =>
    new OrmLiteAuthRepository(c.Resolve<IDbConnectionFactory>()), namedConnnection:"AuthDb"); 
```

### Optimize LIKE Searches

One of the primary goals of OrmLite is to expose and RDBMS agnostic Typed API Surface which will allow you
to easily switch databases, or access multiple databases at the same time with the same behavior.

One instance where this can have an impact is needing to use `UPPER()` in **LIKE** searches to enable 
case-insensitive **LIKE** queries across all RDBMS. The drawback of this is that LIKE Queries are not able 
to use any existing RDBMS indexes. We can disable this feature and return to the default RDBMS behavior with:

```csharp
OrmLiteConfig.StripUpperInLike = true;
```

Allowing all **LIKE** Searches in OrmLite or AutoQuery to use any available RDBMS Index.
    
### OrmLite Community Contributions

We'd like to thank [Evgeny Morozov](https://github.com/shift-evgeny) from the ServiceStack Community 
who contributed several fixes and performance improvements to OrmLite in this release.

## ServiceStack.Redis

### New Redis GEO Operations

The latest [release of Redis 3.2.0](http://antirez.com/news/104) brings it exciting new 
[GEO capabilities](http://redis.io/commands/geoadd) which will let you store Lat/Long coordinates in Redis
and query locations within a specified radius. 

To demonstrate this functionality we've created a new 
[Redis GEO Live Demo](https://github.com/ServiceStackApps/redis-geo) which lets you click on anywhere in 
the U.S. to find the list of nearest cities within a given radius:

[![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceStack/Assets/master/img/livedemos/redis-geo/redisgeo-screenshot.png)](http://redisgeo.servicestack.net/)

> Live Demo: http://redisgeo.servicestack.net

Redis GEO just [imports postal data coordinates](https://github.com/ServiceStackApps/redis-geo/blob/master/README.md#import-geonames-dataset)
for each State from the 
[geonames.org postal data](http://download.geonames.org/export/zip/) for the specified country.

Only the single Service below was required to implement the Apps functionality which just returns all 
locations for a given state within a specified radius, sorted by nearest location:

```csharp
[Route("/georesults/{State}")]
public class FindGeoResults : IReturn<List<RedisGeoResult>>
{
    public string State { get; set; }
    public long? WithinKm { get; set; }
    public double Lng { get; set; }
    public double Lat { get; set; }
}

public class RedisGeoServices : Service
{
    public object Any(FindGeoResults request)
    {
        var results = Redis.FindGeoResultsInRadius(request.State, 
            longitude: request.Lng, latitude: request.Lat,
            radius: request.WithinKm.GetValueOrDefault(20), unit: RedisGeoUnit.Kilometers,
            sortByNearest: true);

        return results;
    }
}
```

Redis's new [GEO Operations](http://redis.io/commands/geoadd) are available in the new 
ServiceStack.Redis API's below:


```csharp
public interface IRedisClient
{
    //...
    long AddGeoMember(string key, double longitude, double latitude, string member);
    long AddGeoMembers(string key, params RedisGeo[] geoPoints);
    double CalculateDistanceBetweenGeoMembers(string key, string from, string to, string unit=null);
    string[] GetGeohashes(string key, params string[] members);
    List<RedisGeo> GetGeoCoordinates(string key, params string[] members);
    string[] FindGeoMembersInRadius(string key, double lng, double lat, double radius, string unit);
    List<RedisGeoResult> FindGeoResultsInRadius(string key, double lng, double lat, double radius, 
        string unit, int? count = null, bool? sortByNearest = null);
    string[] FindGeoMembersInRadius(string key, string member, double radius, string unit);
    List<RedisGeoResult> FindGeoResultsInRadius(string key, string member, double radius, 
        string unit, int? count = null, bool? sortByNearest = null);
}
    
public interface IRedisNativeClient
{
    //...
    long GeoAdd(string key, double longitude, double latitude, string member);
    long GeoAdd(string key, params RedisGeo[] geoPoints);
    double GeoDist(string key, string fromMember, string toMember, string unit = null);
    string[] GeoHash(string key, params string[] members);
    List<RedisGeo> GeoPos(string key, params string[] members);
    List<RedisGeoResult> GeoRadius(string key, double lng, double lat, double radius, string unit,
        bool withCoords=false, bool withDist=false, bool withHash=false, int? count=null, bool? asc=null);
    List<RedisGeoResult> GeoRadiusByMember(string key, string member, double radius, string unit,
        bool withCoords=false, bool withDist=false, bool withHash=false, int? count=null, bool? asc=null);
}
```

### Binary Key APIs

New APIs were added to `RedisNativeClient` which lets persist and access data using a binary key:

```csharp
class RedisNativeClient
{
    void Set(byte[] key, byte[] value, int expirySeconds, long expiryMs = 0);
    void SetEx(byte[] key, int expireInSeconds, byte[] value);
    byte[] Get(byte[] key);
    long HSet(byte[] hashId, byte[] key, byte[] value);
    byte[] HGet(byte[] hashId, byte[] key);
    long Del(byte[] key);
    long HDel(byte[] hashId, byte[] key);
    bool PExpire(byte[] key, long ttlMs);
    bool Expire(byte[] key, int seconds);
}
```

## Slack Logger

The new Slack Logger can be used to send Logging to a custom Slack Channel which is a nice interactive way 
for your development team on Slack to see and discuss logging messages as they come in.

To start using it first download it from NuGet:

    PM> Install-Package ServiceStack.Logging.Slack

Then configure it with the channels you want to log it to, e.g:

```csharp
LogManager.LogFactory = new SlackLogFactory("{GeneratedSlackUrlFromCreatingIncomingWebhook}", 
    debugEnabled:true)
{
    //Alternate default channel than one specified when creating Incoming Webhook.
    DefaultChannel = "other-default-channel",
    //Custom channel for Fatal logs. Warn, Info etc will fallback to DefaultChannel or 
    //channel specified when Incoming Webhook was created.
    FatalChannel = "more-grog-logs",
    //Custom bot username other than default
    BotUsername = "Guybrush Threepwood",
    //Custom channel prefix can be provided to help filter logs from different users or environments. 
    ChannelPrefix = System.Security.Principal.WindowsIdentity.GetCurrent().Name
};

LogManager.LogFactory = new SlackLogFactory(appSettings);
```

Some more usage examples are available in [SlackLogFactoryTests](https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack/blob/master/tests/ServiceStack.Logging.Tests/UnitTests/SlackLogFactoryTests.cs).

## Performance and Memory improvements

Several performance and memory usage improvements were also added across the board in this release where 
all ServiceStack libraries have now switched to using a ThreadStatic `StringBuilder` Cache where possible 
to reuse existing `StringBuilder` instances and save on Heap allocations. 

For similar improvements you can also use the new `StringBuilderCache` in your own code where you'd just 
need to call `Allocate()` to get access to a reset `StringBuilder` instance and call `ReturnAndFree()` 
when you're done to access the `string` and return the `StringBuilder` to the cache, e.g:

```csharp
public static string ToMd5Hash(this Stream stream)
{
    var hash = MD5.Create().ComputeHash(stream);
    var sb = StringBuilderCache.Allocate();
    for (var i = 0; i < hash.Length; i++)
    {
        sb.Append(hash[i].ToString("x2"));
    }
    return StringBuilderCache.ReturnAndFree(sb);
}
```

There's also a `StringBuilderCacheAlt` for when you need access to 2x StringBuilders at the same time.

### String Parsing APIs

In several areas we used `SplitOnFirst()` and `SplitOnLast()` String extension methods to parse strings 
which returns a `string[]` containing the string components we were interested in, e.g we can use it to 
fetch the Type name from a Generic Type Definition with:

```csharp
var genericTypeName = type.GetGenericTypeDefinition().Name.SplitOnFirst('`')[0];
```

Whilst this works it creates a temporary array to store the components. We can get the same result and 
save a Heap Allocation by using the new `LeftPart` API instead:

```csharp
var genericTypeName = type.GetGenericTypeDefinition().Name.LeftPart('`');
```

Which in addition to saving unnecessary allocations, is shorter and reads better, win, win!

The new APIs have the same behavior as the existing `SplitOnFirst()` and `SplitOnLast()` extension methods below:

```csharp
str.LeftPart(':')      == str.SplitOnFirst(':')[0]
str.RightPart(':')     == str.SplitOnFirst(':').Last()
str.LastLeftPart(':')  == str.SplitOnLast(':')[0]
str.LastRightPart(':') == str.SplitOnLast(':').Last()
```

### TypeConstants

We've switched to using the new 
[TypeConstants](https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack.Text/blob/master/src/ServiceStack.Text/TypeConstants.cs) 
which holds static instances of many popular empty collections and `Task<T>` results which you can reuse 
instead of creating new instances, e.g:

```csharp
TypeConstants.EmptyStringArray == new string[0];
TypeConstants.EmptyObjectArray == new object[0];
TypeConstants<CustomType>.EmptyArray == new T[0];
```

### CachedExpressionCompiler

We've added MVC's 
[CachedExpressionCompiler](https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack/blob/master/src/ServiceStack.Common/CachedExpressionCompiler.cs)
to **ServiceStack.Common** and where possible are now using it in-place of Compiling LINQ expressions 
directly in all of ServiceStack libraries.

### GetActivator and GetCachedGenericType

The new `GetCachedGenericType()` and `GetActivator()` API's caches and improves performance when dynamically
creating instances of generic types. We can use this to return a cached compiled delegate accepting any 
number of `object[]` args to dynamically create instances of Typed Tuples, e.g:

```csharp
var genericArgs = new[] { typeof(TypeA), typeof(TypeB) };
Type genericType = typeof(Tuple<,>).GetCachedGenericType(genericArgs);
var ctor = genericType.GetConstructor(genericArgs);

var activator = ctor.GetActivator();

var tuple = (Tuple<TypeA, TypeB>) activator(new TypeA(), new TypeB());
```

### Object Pools

We've added the Object pooling classes that Roslyn's code-base uses in `ServiceStack.Text.Pools` which lets 
you create reusable object pools of instances. The available pools include:

 - `ObjectPool<T>`
 - `PooledObject<T>`
 - `SharedPools`
 - `StringBuilderPool`

### Enum.HasFlag

To [reduce allocations](https://twitter.com/hmemcpy/status/739884409726328832) we've replaced our usage 
of `Enum.HasFlag` to using bit-wise operations instead.

## Other Features

### Add ServiceStack Reference Wildcards

The `IncludeType` option in all 
[Add ServiceStack Reference](https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack/wiki/Add-ServiceStack-Reference)
languages now allow specifying a `.*` wildcard suffix on Request DTO's as a shorthand to return all 
dependent DTOs for that Service, e.g:

    IncludeTypes: RequestDto.*

Special thanks to [@donaldgray](https://github.com/donaldgray) for contributing this feature.

### New ServerEventsClient APIs

Use new Typed [GetChannelSubscribers APIs](https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack/commit/1476e232502f690ba1832600c221ad76c15cfda7)
added to [C#/.NET ServerEventsClient](https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack/wiki/C%23-Server-Events-Client)
to fetch Channel Subscribers, e.g:

```csharp
var clientA = new ServerEventsClient("A");
var channelASubscribers = clientA.GetChannelSubscribers();
var channelASubscribers = await clientA.GetChannelSubscribersAsync();
```

### New IServiceClient APIs

Use the new Typed extension methods to fetch Session Cookies from all Service Clients:

```csharp
var sessionId = client.GetSessionId();
newClient.SetSessionId(sessionId);

var permSessionId = client.GetPermanentSessionId();
newClient.SetPermanentSessionId(permSessionId);

var token = client.GetTokenCookie();
```

### RegisterServicesInAssembly

Plugins can use the new `RegisterServicesInAssembly()` API to register multiple Services in a specified
assembly, e.g:

```csharp
appHost.RegisterServicesInAssembly(GetType().Assembly);
```
    
### FluentValidation

The current `IRequest` is now injected and can be used within child Collection Validators as well, e.g:

```csharp
public class MyRequestValidator : AbstractValidator<CustomRequestError>
{
    public MyRequestValidator()
    {
        RuleSet(ApplyTo.Post | ApplyTo.Put | ApplyTo.Get, () =>
        {
            var req = base.Request;
            RuleFor(c => c.Name)
                .Must(x => !base.Request.PathInfo.ContainsAny("-", ".", " "));

            RuleFor(x => x.Items).SetCollectionValidator(new MyRequestItemValidator());
        });
    }
}

public class MyRequestItemValidator : AbstractValidator<CustomRequestItem>
{
    public MyRequestItemValidator()
    {
        RuleFor(x => x.Name)
            .Must(x => !base.Request.QueryString["Items"].ContainsAny("-", ".", " "));
    }
}
```
        
## [HTTP Utils](github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack/wiki/Http-Utils)

Equivalent Async APIs have been added matching all Sync 
[HTTP Utils](github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack/wiki/Http-Utils) APIs which are now all mockable, e.g:

```csharp
using (new HttpResultsFilter { BytesResult = "mocked".ToUtf8Bytes() })
{
    //= "mocked".ToUtf8Bytes():
    var mocked = await url.GetBytesFromUrlAsync();                                   
    mocked = await url.GetBytesFromUrlAsync(accept: "image/png"); 
    mocked = await url.PostBytesToUrlAsync(requestBody:"postdata=1".ToUtf8Bytes());
}
```
